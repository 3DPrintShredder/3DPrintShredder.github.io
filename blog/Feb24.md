## Progress as of February 24, 2023

The last 2 weeks were spent building and fixing problems that were noticed as the system came closer to being finished. The main problems were that the shrouds covering the motors and belts on the back side of the shredder were not accessible once the electronics back panel was put in place, this made it difficult to take on and off the planers which was needed to adjust the particle size the shredder produced. This problem caused several disassembly of the entire frame, but eventually the planers were put in the right spot and locked down so they should not need to be moved again. The bin has been fully assembled and works well. Now that itâ€™s been added we need to design a way to attach the limit switches to the bin as well as the hopper door which is part of the safety measures to turn the system off if either door is opened.

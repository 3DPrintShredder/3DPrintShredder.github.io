After some shipment troubles, our parts have finally arrived from McMaster-Carr. Now that we have the aluminum extrusions, they can be cut to length, drilled, and tapped according to the CAD model developed over the course of the previous term. All of the electronics have arrived from amazon, so a wire harness also needs to be made in the coming weeks so that all the electronics can be sent to the software team, so they are not roadblocked by mechanical tasks.

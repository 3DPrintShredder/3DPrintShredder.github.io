We spent Saturday cutting, drilling, and tapping the extrusions. The design was made relatively simple so only 4 sections of 500mm extrusions were needed and the rest were cut to 460mm. Having only these 2 cut sizes sped up the work considerably and it only took a couple of hours to cut, drill and tap all 30 extrusions.

## Progress as of January 27, 2023

Construction of the frame has begun. Unfortunately, we ran into a problem with the slots of the McMaster-Carr extrusions being 5mm instead of 6mm, so the t-nuts we bought did not fit. Turns out its incredibly hard to find t-nuts for 5mm slots for a reasonable price (McMaster-Carr sells them for $1.80 each!). We managed to find a seller on Amazon that sells some, unfortunately they are not the drop in style though, so some changes will need to be made to the assembly order such that the t-nuts are slid in place before the ends of the extrusions are blocked off. We are currently still looking for M3 t-nuts that work for the 5mm slots, but in the worst case, we can adjust the design so that everything uses M5 instead.
